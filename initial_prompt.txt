Create a CLAUDE.md file for this project. The goal of the project is to provide a database for Fantasy football
 league data from the Sleeper fantasy football website. Sleeper provides a free API which you can find
 documentation here: https://docs.sleeper.com/

 We need to have some sort of scheduled jobs to fetch all of the data from every endpoint that is provided by the
 Sleeper API but we should store it in a normalized way. From what I can tell from the docs of the API, the
 endpoints are not all strictly REST and the data is not exactly normalized. Study the docs in depth that think
 ultra fucking hard about how to create a database and tables in order to store the data coming from the API in a
 normalized way. We should use Postgresql as a database and use Hasura as a graphql provider to that database. I
 think we can probably make use of some functionality in Hasura to create scheduled jobs that will fetch/upsert
 the sleeper data from the API. Also, I would like for this all to be run in docker containers for ease of
 deployment. Ultimately, the goal is to have an up to date, normalized database of my sleeper fantasy football
 leagues data in a postgresql database and have a hasura instance / graphql interface to that data. My league ID
 is 1199102384316362752, you can use that ID as the one to populate data for.

 Ok, now you gotta think very deeply and very hard - design the architecture of the app, create a PLAN.md and
  break everything down into small actionable tasks. Make sure each part of the design is accounted for in the
  plan. All tasks should be detailed and if they need further investigation in order to make a good design
  decision, then create a reasearch task. Leave no stone unturned when creating the plan, think through all aspects
   of the design, ensure we have solid tests, ensure the deployment and development experience is solid and
  efficient and most importantly - works seemlessly.
