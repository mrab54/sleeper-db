# Final Swagger Verification Report

## Date: 2025-08-27

## Verification Process
Performed a comprehensive double-check of all API responses against the Swagger documentation, examining:
- Field presence and naming
- Data types (string vs integer vs number)
- Nullable fields
- Array vs object responses
- Enum values
- Missing fields

## Additional Corrections Made (Second Pass)

### 1. **User Schema**
- Added 10 additional fields found in user responses:
  - `cookies` (nullable string)
  - `currencies` (nullable object)
  - `data_updated` (nullable string)
  - `deleted` (nullable string)
  - `notifications` (nullable object)
  - `pending` (nullable string)
  - `solicitable` (nullable string)
  - `summoner_name` (nullable string)
  - `summoner_region` (nullable string)
  - `token` (nullable string)

### 2. **League Schema**
- Added fields from user leagues response:
  - `display_order` (nullable integer) - Display order for the league
  - `last_transaction_id` (nullable string) - ID of last transaction

### 3. **TradedPick Schema**
- Added `draft_id` field (integer, nullable) - Present when returned from draft endpoints
- Corrected that draft_id is integer, not string

### 4. **Roster Settings**
- Marked `fpts_against`, `fpts_decimal`, `fpts_against_decimal` as nullable
- These fields are not always present in roster settings

### 5. **PlayoffMatchup Schema**
- Clarified `t1_from` and `t2_from` descriptions
- These objects contain 'w' or 'l' and matchup information

## Verification Summary

## Key Data Type Confirmations

### Strings
- All IDs (user_id, league_id, draft_id as string, player_id, transaction_id)
- Dates (season_start_date, birth_date)
- Names and text fields

### Integers
- roster_id, matchup_id, week numbers
- Timestamps (created, status_updated - milliseconds)
- Draft settings (all are integers, not booleans)
- Some external IDs (espn_id, yahoo_id, stats_id)
- draft_id in TradedPick (when from draft endpoint)

### Numbers (decimals)
- Fantasy points (fpts, points)
- Scoring settings values

### Booleans
- is_bot, is_owner, active, is_keeper
- season_has_scores

### Arrays
- All list endpoints return arrays
- players, starters, reserve, taxi arrays in rosters
- draft_picks, waiver_budget in transactions

### Objects
- Single resource endpoints return objects
- Players endpoint returns object keyed by player_id

## Response Patterns Confirmed

1. **Null Handling**: Many fields can be null even if commonly populated
2. **Empty Arrays**: Future weeks return empty arrays, not 404s
3. **Metadata Fields**: Often contain dynamic keys (e.g., p_nick_1234)
4. **Timestamps**: All in milliseconds since epoch
5. **Missing Fields**: API omits null fields in many cases

## Final Status

✅ **All 21 endpoints thoroughly verified**
✅ **All data types confirmed against actual responses**
✅ **All nullable fields properly marked**
✅ **All missing fields added**
✅ **All enum values validated**
